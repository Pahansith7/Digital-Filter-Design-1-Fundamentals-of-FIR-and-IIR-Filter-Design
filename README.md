# Digital_Filter_Design_Project_Using_Matlab

This project covers the fundamentals of FIR and IIR filter designing. In detail analysis and practical use of the FIR and IIR filters are available in https://github.com/Pahansith7/Digital-Filter-Design-2-Smoothing-Filters-Ensemble-Averaging-and-FIR-and-IIR-Filters-.git repository.

The main requirement of this project is to design a FIR using windowing method and IIR filter using bilinear transformation according to the given specific requirements Including;
- Maximum passband ripple
- Minimum stopband attenuation
- Pass band and stop band edges
